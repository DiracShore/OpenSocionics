# ILE

## Ne-1

ILEs have a natural ability to comprehend the essence of the ideas, theories and phenomena that interest them. In their limitless curiosity, they frequently investigate and discover a wide range of perspectives and viewpoints to conceptualize their understanding of a topic. They are very interested in generating mental abstractions, theories and concepts that are intended describe something more fundamental about our world. ILEs are energized by the process of searching for anything new and interesting, remaining optimistic that the discovered insight could be used to improve reality in some way, even if it seems unworkable in its current state. The creativity of this type is not so much directed towards realizing specific solutions to real-world problems and optimizing the quality of work performed, as they are conveying an abstracted understanding of the world and generating insight as a result \(which in effect, causes their audience to come up with unique ideas themselves\). For this reason, ILEs are not afraid to experiment with the unconventional, sometimes leading them to put forward new and unusual perspectives on a topic purely for the sake of it. At the same time, when the ILE has exhausted the potential of an idea, they will switch to the next interesting idea, occasionally interrupting whatever progress they had made on the previous one.

## Ti-2

The process by which ILEs formulate and categorize information into a logical structure is fairly quick, making sense of the knowledge that they've acquired with relative ease. ILEs commonly use logic as a tool to analyze a theories from multiple angles, determining what is central to that theory while reducing the parts that are extraneous information. They also tend to thrive in settings of open discussion and debate, utilizing prepositions, predicates, dialectics and analogies to advance their understanding of these subjects.

## Se-3

When placed in a situation where they are under pressure to take action, ILEs can grudgingly take charge in a position of leadership to resolve a situation. They are aware of the need to be assertive and confrontational when necessary, yet this will almost never be the first choice of action for ILEs as their inclination is to search for a more unconventional and interesting way to deal with a problem. In the presence of a more competitive environment where people are actively focused on accomplishing their goals, ILEs are disinterested in having to acclimate themselves to the fixed standards of competition as to avoid putting themselves under persistent stress. ILEs would much rather seek a more laid-back, soothing haven as a place to retreat to, for the purpose of regaining composure when things get too tough.

## Fi-4

Interpreting the personal attitudes, sentiments and feelings of others is an area in which the ILE has difficulty evaluating and is relatively oblivious to. Often, this obliviousness manifests as ILEs not having a clue what level of closeness other people occupy in relation to them. ILEs are fundamentally nonjudgmental people to a fault, finding the degree of personal bias when forming harsh moral imperatives to be ineffective when alternative explanations for a person's behavior exist.

## Si-5

Frequently, ILEs can get so caught up in their hobbies, work and activities that they recurrently neglect their physical needs. This quality of absent-mindedness can cause the ILE to underestimate the impact the physical environment has on their internal needs. Similarly, they can also get so invested in the intellectual development of their ideas that they lose sight of the specific details pertinent to their daily routine. ILEs find it disorienting when having to determine what would make them feel comfortable themselves, though when a pleasurable source of comfort is found, the ILE happily indulges in this activity to calm their active mind.

## Fe-6

ILEs greatly appreciate an atmosphere of outward optimism and lightheartedness where they can unwind and be themselves in. They are often motivated to present themselves as witty, jovial and animated individuals for the sake of being liked and to incur a positive response from someone. However, ILEs lack the ability to regulate this themselves and can be unaware of whether said something tasteless or obscene. When made aware of this though, they might feel hurt in response to this criticism and tone their behavior down to level of calm friendliness. 

## Ni-7

Although capable of deepening their understanding of a subject, the area of an ILE's expertise typically extends to a broad range of abstract and theoretical topics. ILEs find focusing on the same set of subjects for too long as limiting their ability to think creatively about the subject and will want to move onto something that is more interesting to them. Furthermore, ILEs consciously reject the fatalistic outcomes that refute the potential of their ideas. This type seldom delves into a state of reflection about the future ahead of them, feeling constrained by sticking to only one path in life. To counteract this issue, ILEs are motivated to find a lifestyle that will allow them to pursue their peculiar hobbies with ease.

## Te-8

Over the course of their lives, ILEs tend to accumulate a rather dense stockpile of factual information that they can situationally rely on to generate novel solutions to everyday problems. Although, ILEs do not always use their knowledge in this way and are entirely comfortable with learning whatever interests them in the moment, irrespective of its real-world applicability.
