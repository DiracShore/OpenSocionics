# LII

## Ti-1

LIIs are analytical investigators of the structures and principles that ordain their lives. The interests of the LII essentially exist in the intellectual domain, where they rationally uncover and evaluate the reasoning that ordain logical relationships. Although these types can perform well in scientific fields, LIIs will nonetheless want to understand and be able to explain the topics that interest them at length. Mainly, the process by which LIIs construct logical concepts are very thorough, with them naturally revisiting and thinking over the given reasons for their constructs until they are certain that the conclusion that they have reached is absolutely correct.

## Ne-2

In service of their own analyses, LIIs perceive the multiple avenues of potential that are related to a given idea or concept with delineation and clarity. The LII's orientation is towards the wide range of perspectives of where their logic can be applied across seemingly different cases and circumstances, posing unique thought experiments and theoretical proofs in an effort to encourage people to entertain different points of view. Frequently, LIIs will be guided by their own intellectual curiosity, alternating between expansively drawing upon information from multiple sources to deeply exploring a narrow range of topics.

## Fi-3

LIIs are sometimes aware of how they might feel internally, though they don't always treat these sentiments with the same attention. As a consequence, they may seem to be overly formalistic and measured in how they present themselves to others. When debating against someone using detached reasoning, LIIs can occasionally alienate others with their strong opinions on a subject and will not side with someone simply because they personally like them or consider them a friend. These types want to be able to maintain their relationships with other people while not having to commit themselves to a specific set of people.

## Se-4

LIIs portray a mild-mannered demeanor and are avoidant of situations where they are expected to act decisively and forcefully to get something done. If pressured or confronted from the outside, LIIs can utterly fail to defend themselves in these situations, resulting in them withdrawing from conflict altogether and inwardly turning their criticism on themselves.

## Fe-5

LIIs want to be socially accepted by people who consider them to be insightful and have interesting things to say. However, LIIs are not very skilled at bringing people together and often expect others to create an atmosphere of positive emotions for them. Once a positive mood has been set, LIIs can appear to be more cordial and jovial than they usually are, left to their own devices. If LIIs are unable to find a source of positive emotionality in their lives, they can be more isolated and privacy-seeking. 

## Si-6

In principle, LIIs want to be able to discover the physical activities that give them a sense of enjoyment and groundedness in the present. The range of these activities may vary from person to person, though the scope of these activities are therapeutic in nature and require a careful attention to detail. LIIs will typically pursue these activities in great moderation to avoid physical exhaustion. In this sense, it would not be unrealistic some LIIs to have athletic hobbies, as it's not too competitive or physically demanding. However, LIIs can just as easily seclude themselves from an environment such as this if they find it is too overwhelming. LIIs also normally express some confidence in being able to dress tastefully, though it is far more important to them that what they're wearing is physically comfortable.

## Te-7

LIIs have a natural preference towards carefully deducing logical conclusions from the facts they encounter. When collecting the data necessary to reaffirm these conclusions, the LII will treat ambiguous assortments of data with skepticism and instead see if they align with the systems they've created. While LIIs can passively collect a dense knowledge base over time, they will be very selective about what facts are used perfect their logical line of reasoning. The LII is primarily more concerned that the rationale for their structure is correct rather than whether or not it is useful.

## Ni-8

Generally speaking, LIIs are very pensive individuals who devote a lot of energy to contemplating and observing how patterns develop over time. However, this type will often feel more inclined to convert their insightful observations into static categories that are internally consistent and contingent. In this way, the structures that LIIs produce can often be so abstract and expansive that they might not even have a teleological end, purpose or application in the real world. Many LIIs can develop their own philosophical perspective on life by integrating the conclusions reached by many different perspectives and see little point in narrowing their own perspective into a condensed, concrete model.
