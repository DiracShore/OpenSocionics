Beta types share a common quality of passionate intensity towards achieving the causes they find meaningful. In the Extroverted Beta types \(EIE and SLE\), this intensity is projected outward onto their environment, consistently manifesting as emotional dynamism and an assertive directedness towards changing the present. This expression is modified somewhat in the Introverted Beta types \(LSI and IEI\), as this intensity is mostly directed inward and expressed during periods of high activity. Furthermore, Betas are drawn to environments of unrestricted free-expression, where they can authentically share how they feel and in more serious instances, move people to action.

Betas care a lot about preserving the precision and clarity of their worldviews. As a consequence, Beta types prefer to have a narrow range of perspectives that are consistent with their ideology. They also tend to be drawn to sources of knowledge that reveal the hidden and profound qualities about our world, even if it may seem abstruse and cryptic. The latter quality is more commonly observed in the Introverted Beta types \(LSI and IEI\) who are inwardly focused on mentally revising and perfecting what they believe in than the Extroverted Beta types \(EIE and SLE\) who are outwardly focused on impacting and influencing a variety of people.
