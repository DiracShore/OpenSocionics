# Intertype Relations

Socionics is not only a theory of personality type, but a theory of human interaction. Indeed, one of Aushra’s primary motivations for creating Socionics was to provide the answer to hard philosophical problems such as what causes love, why some people naturally get along/conflict and why we have different psychological needs. However, there are factors to human psychology that are variable and context dependent and human relationships are the same way. In Socionics, the theory of intertype relationships does not argue that the specific relation between two types will always turn out like the descriptions depict them to develop, there are unknown variables that cannot be factored into the descriptions because they exist outside the domain of personality theory. What Socionics seeks to describe is the fixed patterns of between a generalized relationship between two personality types, since there are always deeply embedded perceptual preferences within a person that cannot change with life experience.

## Same Quadra Relations

### Identity

The identity relation describes the relation between two types that are the same, sharing quadra values, strengths, weaknesses and energy levels. Types in the identity relation can easily understand each other well and can interactions are often enjoyable and interesting. Despite not being able to help each other out to a large degree, the type which has more experience in an area of life can provide wisdom and advice to the less experienced type. If this is not possible, identicals can at least understand and empathize with each other over their common struggles. However, since these types have the same psychological motivations, this can result in identicals competing for the same goals, even if neither person wants to do so. This relation is often good, so long as each person respects the fulfillment of the other’s potential.

### Duality

The dual relation describes two types that are the complete opposite of each other in almost every respect, except for quadra values. Duals have a psychological “Yin and Yang” effect on each other, with each partner’s strengths perfectly complementing the other’s weaknesses. This effect results in duals effortlessly becoming close, knowing exactly how to provide support when needed and genuinely enjoying time spent with each other.

### Mirror

The mirror relation describes two types that are similar in their strengths, weaknesses and quadra values, but opposite in their energy levels. Types in the mirror relation can easily connect with and form a natural understanding each other, as if they are looking at a “mirror” reflection of themselves \(hence the name\). Out of all the inter-type relations, the mirror relation is by far the most conversational and didactic, where each partner takes turns adding and revising new information to the other’s perspective. However, the verbal nature of the relationship can end up exhausting both sides, needing to take breaks to recharge from each other.

### Activity

The activity relation describes two types that are similar in their energy levels and quadra values, but opposite in their strengths and weaknesses. Since the horizontal blocks of each type compliment each other, these types consequently feel at ease when around each other and understand how to take care of each other’s needs. However, these types can cycle between periods of being over-stimulation or under-stimulation, momentarily being too much or too boring for each other. Despite these cycles between intensity and slowness, this relation is generally very stable and rewarding, but requires partners to take short breaks from each other from time to time.

## Opposing Quadra Relations

### Conflict

The conflict relation describes two types that are the complete opposite of each other in every respect. Since each type’s base function is the other’s vulnerable function, both types in this relation will be afraid to be themselves around the other. As such, conflictors end up naturally avoiding each other. The “conflict” of this relation does not take initially take place out in the open, rather it is hidden from each other until the moment they are forced to cooperate, resulting in mutual frustration and animosity for each other.

### Quasi-Identity

The quasi-identical relation describes two types that are similar in their strengths, weaknesses and energy levels, but opposite in quadra values. These types can appear superficially similar to each other on the outside, but have motivations and values that strongly contrast with each other, making them near opposites on the inside. Despite not being suited to support each other whatsoever, quasi-identicals have a better chance of getting along with each other in contrast to the other opposing quadra relations

### Extinguishment

The extinguishment relation describes two types that are similar in their strengths and weaknesses, but are the opposite of each other in almost every respect. The one thing that these types may have in common with each other are similar interests, but even when it comes to this, they take diametrically opposed approaches to them. What ends up happening is both partners will end up criticizing and correcting the other on what they see as very important. Not only is this relation not suited for mutual support, but it also ends up being a deeply confusing experience for both partners.

### Super-Ego

The super-ego relation describes two types that are similar in their energy levels, but are the opposite of each other in almost every respect. Initially, the super-ego relation is one characterized by mild interest, since both partners are of the same temperament. In formal settings, these types can essentially cover each other’s weaknesses, making cooperation and team-building a much simpler task. However, on a personal level, these types find that they have much less in common than they initially thought and future interactions will be mutually frustrating at a close psychological distance.

## Adjacent Quadra Relations

### Kindred

The kindred relation describes two types that are similar in energy levels, have the same accepting functions and the opposite producing functions. Because of this, types in the kindred relation have share similar psychological needs, but have diametrically opposed means of meeting these needs. Kindred types can also easily connect with each other over shared interests and perspectives, but deeper connections beyond this is uncommon.

### Business

The business relation describes two types that are similar in energy levels, have the same producing functions and the opposite accepting functions. Because of this, types in the business relation have diametrically opposed psychological needs, but share similar approaches to meeting these needs. Communication is generally good, but similar to kindred relations, deeper connection is uncommon.

### Semi-duality

The semi-dual relation describes two types that have complimentary accepting functions, but antithetical producing functions. Since the accepting functions of each type compliment each other, semi-duals are able to fulfill each other’s primary psychological needs, providing the right amount of support. However, semi-duals are unable to fulfill the other half of each other’s needs, resulting in a feeling of mutual incompleteness.

### Mirage

The mirage relation describes two types that have antithetical accepting functions, but complimentary producing functions. Since the producing functions of each type compliment each other, mirage relations are able to provide some degree of support for each other in a way that is useful. Similar to semi-duality, the feeling of mutual incompleteness can also arise.

## Asymmetric Relations

### Benefactor 

In this asymmetric relation, the benefactor’s base function lines up with the beneficiary’s demonstrative function. Because of this, the benefactor may see the beneficiary as an interesting, like-minded person and will try to get closer to them. However, since the benefactor’s creative function is the beneficiary’s suggestive function, the beneficiary’s constant requests for psychological support can be draining on the benefactor.

### Beneficiary 

In this asymmetric relation, the beneficiary’s base function lines up with the benefactor’s mobilizing function. Because of this, the beneficiary may see the benefactor as trying too hard to please them and will not be all that interested in being close to them. However, since the beneficiary’s suggestive function is the benefactor’s creative function, the beneficiary will eventually feel supported by the benefactor to the point of dependence.

### Supervisor

In this asymmetric relation, the supervisor’s base function is ends up monitoring the supervisee’s vulnerable function. Because of this, the supervisor initially views the supervisee with confusion and disbelief at their weaknesses, potentially even viewing them with contempt. Since the creative function of the supervisor is the base function of the supervisee, the supervisor may see themselves in the supervisee and take it upon themselves to instruct them in an effort to help them improve. However, the supervisor will not be aware of the supervisee’s discomfort in their approach to helping them and may be taken aback when the supervisee eventually decides to suddenly break the relationship off.

### Supervisee

In this asymmetric relation, the supervisee’s base function is the creative function of the supervisor. Because of this, the supervisee initially views their supervisor with cordiality and optimism that is quickly crushed by the feeling of guilt that they cannot meet their expectations. This subsequent effect is due to the supervisee’s vulnerable function being pressured by the supervisor’s base function. Eventually, the feeling of inadequacy may result in the supervisee feeling that their supervisor hates them, which may cause them to suddenly break the relationship off.
