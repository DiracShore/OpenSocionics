# Gamma

## SeFi \| FiSe

Gammas evaluate the character of people from a grounded viewpoint, remaining skeptical that people can change all that much. They are highly selective in their interactions with people, moving toward people they view as having good character and moving away from people they view as having bad character. Although all Gammas are firm and critical in their personal judgments of people, the frequency and volatility of judgments can vary depending on the type. Gammas also highly value personal loyalty and have no issue cutting people off \(or in some cases, getting revenge\) should the person overstep ethical boundaries.

## NiTe \| TeNi

Gammas are naturally skeptical of structural and systematic ways of interpreting phenomena. They want to preserve the factual integrity of the information source, refraining from making connections to other sources and dismissing existing connections that don't work. Since Gammas care about optimizing the efficiency of the work done, they prefer to go with practically implementable ideas that can get verifiable results in the real world.

## SeTe \| TeSe

Gammas are focused on accumulating the practical knowledge necessary for them to get results in the real world. Often, Gammas are ambitious and career-oriented people, striving to fulfill their own goals independently of others through decisive activity. 

## NiFi \| FiNi

Gammas prefer to selectively interact with people they like, ignoring the social ambiance to communicate directly. They exercise careful scrutiny when forming close relationships with people and are unafraid of telling people like it is, even if what they have to say is harsh.
