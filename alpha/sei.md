# SEI

## Si-1

SEIs are readily focused on improving the quality of their lived experience by cultivating beautiful and comfortable environments. In the process of adapting to these environments, it is very important for SEIs to maintain a sense of balance. In the face of rapid change, the SEI can unhurriedly dismiss these changes as an obstacle that lies between them and personal satisfaction. SEIs prefer to take the time to appreciate the simple pleasures that life has to offer in the present moment, devoting great attention to their own comfort and the comfort of others.

## Fe-2

SEIs often portray a jovial, peaceful temperament and invest a significant portion of attention towards maintaining a harmonious social atmosphere. The level of sociability that SEIs have can range from highly sociable in groups of close friends to shy and reserved towards those they are unfamiliar with. Nevertheless, these types take delight in cheering people up with a disarming sweetness.

## Ni-3

While moderately adept at considering possible future outcomes and sticking to a linear path in life, this is secondary to the SEI's focus on the present. They can sometimes languidly respond to situations that require them to plan their lives several steps ahead or mentalize developing trends that have minimal tangibility in reality. However, if careful planning can secure their comfort in the future, SEIs can react to these future developments with a degree of anxiety and sometimes overestimate the amount of planning for required for a possible situation.

## Te-4

SEIs commonly have difficulties with productivity, neither wanting to compromise relaxation, but not wanting to disappoint people work. SEIs will get easily stressed from having to focus extensively on mastering a new skillset. SEIs can also be hopelessly impractical and unskeptical of the ideas they encounter.

## Ne-5

Despite sticking to their own comfort zone, SEIs are very receptive to new perspectives that have the potential to broaden their understanding of the world. For this reason, they highly appreciate brainstorming sessions, as a wide variety of ideas and suggestions are introduced to them that they hadn't even thought of. This diversity of these ideas gives the SEI more options to choose from and experiment with to enhance their enjoyment of the present.

## Ti-6

Commonly, SEI are drawn to will strive to become more knowledgeable in an intellectual domain of their interest, to the point where they can "prove" their intellect to others. However, SEIs are very aware of their inadequacies in this area and can be quite hard on themselves if they think they have made a mistake.

## Se-7

In cultivating an environment of blissful enjoyment, SEIs wish to create a haven for themselves to escape from the conflict and aggression in their lives. They very easily tire from combativeness and environments where harsh behavior is commonplace. Occasionally, they can be be taken advantage of as a consequence of their accepting nature and can have difficulty asserting themselves to get their own way.

## Fi-8

SEIs adeptly form close friendships with those they personally like and think would make an excellent addition to their social circle. Rarely does the SEI ever harshly judge a person's character out in the open, as they are far more concerned with maintaining a positive atmosphere.
