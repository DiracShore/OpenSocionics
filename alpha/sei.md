* Cultivator of aesthetic and comfortable environments, subtly adapting to them to meet their own internal demands.

* Friendly, optimistic

## Ni-3

While moderately adept at considering possible future outcomes and sticking to a linear path in life, this is secondary to the SEI's focus on the present. They can sometimes languidly respond to situations that require them to plan their lives several steps ahead or mentalize developing trends that have minimal tangibility in reality. However, if careful planning can secure their comfort in the future, SEIs can react to these future developments with a degree of anxiety and sometimes overestimate the amount of planning for required for a possible situation.

## Te-4

SEIs commonly have difficulties with productivity, neither wanting to compromise relaxation, but not wanting to disappoint people work. SEIs will get easily stressed from having to focus extensively on mastering a new skillset. SEIs can also be hopelessly impractical and unskeptical of the ideas they encounter,

## Ne-5

Despite sticking to their own comfort zone, SEIs are very receptive to new perspectives that have the potential to broaden their understanding of the world. For this reason, they highly appreciate brainstorming sessions, as a wide variety of ideas and suggestions are introduced to them that they hadn't even thought of. This diversity of these ideas gives the SEI more options to choose from and experiment with to enhance their enjoyment of the present.

## Ti-6

Commonly, the SEI will strive to become more knowledgeable in an intellectual domain of their interest, to the point where they can "prove" their intellect to others. However, SEIs are very aware of their inadequacies in this area and can be quite hard on themselves if they think they have made a mistake.

## Se-7

In cultivating an environment of blissful enjoyment, SEIs wish to create a haven for themselves to escape from the conflict and aggression in their lives. They very easily tire from combativeness and environments where harsh behavior is commonplace. Occasionally, they can be be taken advantage of as a consequence of their accepting nature and can have difficulty asserting themselves to get their own way. When under prolonged social discomfort, SEIs will be passive-aggressive, suppressing their anger up until it boils over. However, SEIs will just as easily apologize for getting angry in the first place, not wanting to be a source of stress for others.

## Fi-8

SEIs adeptly form close friendships with those they personally like and think would make an excellent addition to their social circle. Rarely does the SEI ever harshly judge a person's character out in the open, as they are far more concerned with maintaining a positive atmosphere.
