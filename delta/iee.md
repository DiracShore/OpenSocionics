# IEE

## Ne-1

IEEs are characterized by their broad conceptual perceptiveness and motivation to understand the potential of the ideas they encounter. Their approach to life is to openly seek out novel ideas and experiences, pursing the most interesting activity until a new, more interesting opportunity presents itself along the way. Often, IEEs will whimsically devote themselves to a new project, activity or hobby, exploring and learning as much as they can from it until their curiosity is satisfied. In this way, IEEs highly values their own autonomy, wanting to have the freedom to pursue their interests without constraint.

## Fi-2

Commonly, the interests of the IEE will bring them into contact with a variety of people who share their interests. They genuinely enjoy connecting and learning about the people they meet, since their natural curiosity extends to the sphere of relationships. This results in them building a diverse network of people they are friendly with, though due to rate at which this network can expand, maintaining all of these connections they have made with people is a more challenging task. For people to form a closer relationship with the IEE, they must respect their freedom to explore new opportunities and avoid forcing them to make commitments they are not interested in pursuing.

## Se-3

Occasionally, the IEE can be insistent about getting other people on board with their interests and are capable of pushing themselves, as well as others, to get things done. However, being assertive doesn't come naturally to the IEE and such activities can cost them a lot of energy. Similarly, acting in a way which is more viscerally critical of someone's character conflicts with the IEE's chance-giving nature, as they are usually more inclined to give people the benefit of the doubt than make someone they could have wrongly judged uncomfortable.

## Ti-4

While not necessarily lacking in their conceptual understanding of the world, the IEE has difficulty adapting what they learn to the structural and systematic, preferring instead to select the parts of the structure that works the best for them. This comes at the cost of precision and consistency in the IEEs perspective, resulting in them unaware of the contradictions present in the variety of perspectives they've accepted, regardless of how factually informed they actually are. Furthermore, IEEs can worry about having to abide by rules that, from their perspective, will only manage to limit their freedom and autonomy.

## Si-5

IEEs can be so focused on their own interests that they can neglect their own physical needs. As a way to resolve this deficit, IEEs are receptive to ways in which they can improve their lifestyles to make their surroundings more comfortable, relaxing and convenient. In a sense, IEEs are drawn to a lived experience where they are not burdened by their physical responsibilities, but also not limited in their capacity to look after themselves.

## Te-6

A lifelong goal for IEEs is improving themselves to become more self-sufficient and competent at a range of practical and useful skills. What helps IEEs improve is their motivation to learning as much as they can about a topic of interest and figuring out how to apply it themselves. However, IEEs run the risk of overextending themselves, believing that they know how to apply what they've learned, but end up applying it in a way which is inefficient and wasteful.

## Ni-7

The IEE is focused on the realization of creative opportunities in the real world, an approach which is at odds with detaching into a deeply imaginative state. While this can be useful to the IEE in gaining deeper insight or understanding the profound importance behind what they are currently exploring, they are not always disposed towards idle reflection since they might fear that it will negatively impact their productivity.

## Fe-8

IEEs frequently display an outward emotional warmth and friendliness out of genuine goodwill for people. However, they are not strongly motivated to maintain the emotional atmosphere of the group, preferring to brighten the mood around people they enjoy being around and distancing themselves from the social spotlight. Similarly, IEEs self-controlled in their emotional expression, knowing how to adjust their expression of how they feel internally depending on how close they feel with the person they are communicating with.
