# Gamma

## SeFi \| FiSe



## NiTe \| TeNi

Gammas are naturally skeptical of structural and systematic ways of interpreting phenomena. They want to preserve the factual integrity of the information source, refraining from making connections to other sources and dismissing existing connections that don't work. Since Gammas care about optimizing the efficiency of the work done, they prefer to go with practically implementable ideas that can get verifiable results in the real world.

Gammas prefer direct and unfiltered communication, ignoring the social ambiance to selectively connect and interact with specific people. They exercising careful scrutiny when forming new relationships with people and are unafraid of telling people like it is if they dislike that person.
