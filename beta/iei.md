# IEI

## Ni-1

IEIs are highly reflective individuals who devote themselves to the development of their inner world. Their natural state is one of introspective contemplation, searching through past experiences and forming conceptual connections across time. In this way, they form a unified vision of what they believe the future should be like or where it is heading towards. Furthermore, the mentalizations of IEIs have an interpersonal slant, sticking to their envisioned path and helping others along the way to ensure that the final outcome predicted by them comes to fruition.

## Fe-2

The emotions expressed by IEIs are subtle, carefully adjusting and adapting in conversation to the emotions of others. IEIs generally come across as more introversive when left to their own devices, but can be demonstratively charming and theatrical in social environments. They prefer environments of free-expression as it gives them way to liberate themselves from the intensity and depth of their inner emotional states. In this way, IEIs can be drawn to mediums of expression found in the arts and humanities as a way to properly communicate their insights to others. Once they have developed a deep connection with a community that shares their values, they can become heartfelt communicators and diplomats for them, smoothing over relations between people and bringing them together.

## Si-3

The connection the IEI has with their physical environment tends to be limited to the basic maintenance of their own physical comfort. They may give some attention to the aesthetic of their appearance or bringing about momentary harmony by smoothing over unnecessary conflicts, though ironically, their true attitude towards the physical environment is characterized by their fundamental rejection of it, given that it is not developing in the way they envision.

## Te-4

The idiosyncratic perspectives of the IEI can come across to others as overly arcane and esoteric, leaving much of what they claim to be outside of what can easily be proven by direct observation. Furthermore, IEIs are unconcerned with matters about efficiency and productivity, 

## Se-5

The intensive focus of IEIs on their own imagination causes them to remain indecisive and inert once the demands of the outside world are placed upon them. Cases where immediate action is required of them can either result in them not acting fast or confidently enough to get something done. At the same time, the visions crafted by IEIs demand both quick, impactful action and strong leadership in order to manifest in reality. For this reason, IEIs will seek to ally themselves with the people who possess the authority and strength of will to keep people on the path they believe the world should be heading towards.

## Ti-6

IEIs often seek to construct for themselves an absolute framework of abstract principles that serve as the logical foundation for what they believe to be most meaningful in the world. In this way, IEIs can become intellectual devotees in academic circles, seeking additional knowledge or clarification from those who have inspired them by before outlining their own understanding with certainty. Frequently, the IEI will treat the validity of these systems with stubborn confidence, but if challenged by others, they can hide their confidence and demonstrate a more personable openness in an attempt to halt direct criticism.

## Ne-7

IEIs are disinterested in exploring possibilities that have little connection to the insights they've already developed. Despite being fully capable of brainstorming alternatives on their own, IEIs fundamentally reject ideas that don't align with what they've already identified as meaningful, believing them to function as potential distractions from their higher purpose.

## Fi-8

IEIs are very skilled at building personal connections with people and having an overall sense of those they are drawn to. They tend to be less inclined to evaluate people solely by their inner character and prefer to look more closely at whether or not they see that person as playing significant role in their life.
