# Alpha

## NeTi \| TiNe

Alphas are interested in exploring, investigating and understanding the natural world for its own sake. They view factual information as having a quality of logical interdependence, perceiving the parts that are common to different fields as being fundamentally interconnected as a whole. In that sense, the Alpha worldview is one in which multiple perspectives have been synthesized together to form an all-encompassing worldview that can logically account for every possible context. Alphas are also optimistic realizing new ideas, placing greater value in its potential than its present viability. 

## SiFe \| FeSi

Alphas believe that life should be enjoyed calmly and experienced simply for what it is. They are drawn to environments of positive expression because they are more sensitive to negativity and unpleasantness overall and prefer to keep their interactions with people harmonious. Furthermore, Alphas tend to freely associate between various groups and people, feeling energized by the jovial emotional energy present rather than the existing connections they have with any one group or individual.

Alphas naturally assume that most people are good at their core, suspending judgment until they are certain the person has bad intent. On average, they are more inclined to forgive and resolve altercations with people, wanting to be friendly with and fair to everyone. If they do have a falling out with someone, they are more likely to simply distance themselves from the person to avoiding potentially negative future interactions than cut the person off. In addition, Alphas tend to have a goofy, nonsensical style of humor, seeking out playful and lighthearted interactions to uplift themselves and others \(more visible in the Extroverted types\).
