# SEE

## Se-1

SEEs are chiefly characterized by their gregarious energy and fierce ambition. The focus of their aspirations are commonly twofold, with them both seeking to expand their personal achievements and social impact on society. In this way, SEEs are exercise their social energy to persuade, motivate and lead people to action. They are fully in their element when they are able to tactically seek out new opportunities and experiences for themselves in the real world. 

## Fi-2

SEEs are greatly attentive to the personal attitudes they have towards other people and are quick to judge the character of others. Similarly, SEEs are also proactive network-builders, more easily navigating social relationships and expanding their social circle to include more people. However, among their truly close relationships, SEEs can be less flighty and more devoted, doing all that they can to support and protect the people they deeply cherish. Their only non-negotiable demand in their relations with others is their independence and any attempt to challenge or compromise on this will be met with fierce vitriol.

## Ne-3

If tackling an issue by sheer force of will didn't work for an SEE, they can be capable of perceiving and considering alternative tactics. However, their awareness of potential tends to be limited to how they can improvise in the present moment. Similarly, they can are also be somewhat aware that there is more to someone's character than meets the eye, but are nonetheless more inclined to stick to what their initial instinct about someone in the first place.

## Ti-4

SEEs find it very difficult to understand abstract and analytical concepts that cannot be demonstrated to them in real life. Intangible information such as this, which often isn't practical or applicable in the first place, will be easily forgotten and filtered out. When it comes to prescriptive structures on how to act or behave, the SEE simply wants to do what works for them instead. If what they want to do goes against a general principle, they will gladly disregard in favor of what seems to works better for them in the moment. To the SEE, rules that do not work in their favor are seen by them as an unnecessary constraint on their personal liberty.

## Ni-5

SEEs are largely inhibited in their ability to reflect upon the longer-term consequences of their actions. The overall lack of caution in the SEE manifests in an impatience to quickly get things done, getting frustrated when they run into unforeseen obstacles that could have been avoided by thinking more carefully about it instead of acting on impulse. For this reason, SEEs greatly appreciate the counsel of critical and contemplative individuals who can tell them bluntly whether the action they want to take will end up being successful or a disaster.

## Te-6

In their pursuit of personal success, SEEs can be very eager to demonstrate their diligence and competence to others. While they are proactive and determined to learn practical skills, they are not always aware of how the knowledge they have accumulated can be applied in their own lives. As a result, they can be predisposed to experimenting with different methods and searching for simple shortcuts until something ends up working for them. However, relying purely trial and error will lead to repeated failure, which can become a source of inner distress for the SEE. This can eventually become an area of growth for the SEE, becoming a trustworthy source of procedural knowledge themselves.

## Si-7

SEEs are capable of looking after themselves and their physical space well, knowing that a well-cultivated aesthetic can impress the right people. While SEEs usually have a clear materialistic bent, they are very rarely given interested in living in such an environment for the sake of relaxation, believing it to be too idle or boring for their tastes. For these types, a comfortable environment is simply a way to recharge once they feel fatigued, so that they can mobilize whenever they feel like it.

## Fe-8

SEEs emanate a powerful emotional energy that often makes them easily recognizable at social gatherings. They have a particular enthusiasm for connecting with people, charming them with engaging warmth and a charismatic attitude. While they might enjoy entertaining others and drawing attention to themselves, they are less interested in maintaining or directing the emotional atmosphere of a group. In such cases, SEEs are unafraid of expressing how they feel with harsh honesty, regardless of how people might feel about it.
