# LSE

## Te-1

LSEs are distinguished by their ability to readily learn and apply useful information towards solving practical problems. Commonly, LSEs are avid researchers in multiple topics of interest, acquiring not only a wealth of practical knowledge in the process, but its real-world application. In this way, LSEs aspire to know how things work for the sake of knowing how they can be improved and configured to run more efficiently. While usually inclined to environments of academic learning, LSEs prefer to learn and teach others through direct experience, believing that learning how something works yourself is far more valuable than any one source of information could ever convey.

## Si-2

LSEs are meticulous in ensuring that the physical spaces they inhabit are both harmonious and functional, believing that investing effort into organizing their surroundings is necessary to maintain optimal efficiency. This environmental attentiveness can also bring LSEs great benefit in their work, placing a great deal of effort in perfecting the physical quality and utility of what they produce. Similarly, this attitude also applies to LSEs themselves, looking after their well-being and internal demands with care. In addition, it is rare for LSEs to exhaust themselves from overwork, as they understand the need for rest and relaxation as necessary to best maintain their physical state.

## Fe-3

While LSEs can come across as positive and friendly in social environments, they are not comfortable with outwardly expressing themselves around others they do not know so well. In this way, the charm and persuasiveness of LSEs will be largely limited by its usefulness in connecting with others.

## Ni-4

LSEs are realists in every sense of the word, so much so, that their immersion in their immediate surroundings makes thinkin deeply about what lies ahead in their future a difficult task for them. This lack of attentiveness towards the longer-term consequences of their work can lead them to take on too many activities at once and having their efforts end up wasted due to poor planning. Similarly, LSEs dislike having to limit themselves to a singular path in life, preferring to improve upon themselves in many different areas and continue to provide knowledgeable assistance to others in the present.

## Fi-5

While aspiring to form deep and personal connections with those they care about, LSEs are frequently unsure about how close they are to others and will even doubt or question how they actually feel internally. They may be overly formal or direct around others as a way to hide their feelings and rarely feel comfortable pursuing closer relationships with people if it is not clear to them how they feel. They greatly appreciate the support from someone who can help assess the nature of their personal sentiments and take time aside to develop a closer bond with them.

## Ne-6

LSEs would like to become highly creative and outside-of-the-box thinkers, but they are unsure how to best realize the potential of the ideas they generate. It is more common for LSEs to improve upon themselves or their work by engaging in a process of trial-and-error, opting to figure out the most optimal solution through hard-work rather than abstract forethought. However, this can result in LSEs devoting themselves to working tirelessly and enthusiastically on a project that leads nowhere, at which point the LSE will conclude that they need to work harder next time, at which point they have already focused themselves on a new project of interest and started the cycle again.

## Ti-7

Although very quick to learn new information through direct experience and observation, LSEs rarely give thought to systemizing what they learn into a logical framework or abstract categories. What is of fundamental importance to LSEs is ensuring what they know is externally verifiable and by extension, able to work in practice. As such, if a theory, ideology or other logical abstraction cannot be demonstrated to be applicable in reality, then they will easily disregard it and prefer to rely on factual knowledge from credible sources or their own experience.

## Se-8

LSEs are very often energetic and diligent, making them productive contributors to the myriad of tasks, activities, projects they are involved in. Although naturally inclined to downplay their toughness, the LSE can be very confrontational if they perceive their opportunities for carrying out good work are being limited in some way. While the LSE can operate well in leadership roles due to their resilience and decisiveness, they would much rather occupy such a position only for the purpose of benefitting the community as a whole rather than seek power for its own sake. Even in cases where the LSE does occupy a position of authority, they still tend towards the role of an administrator or instructor than that of a commander.
