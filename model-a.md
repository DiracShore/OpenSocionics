# Model A

During the development of Socionics, Aushra Augusta made the important realization that all 8 information elements are present in the human psyche, but each individual information element possesses a different level of strength, priority and awareness in a person. She theorized that there must be a mathematical model of the human psyche which structures the 8 information elements into 8 unique functions of psychological input and output. Thus, in 1978, Model A \(A is short for Augusta\) was created. The information elements cannot be placed arbitrarily, otherwise there would be 40320 \(8! = 40320\) personality types and not 16. The rules for the placement of these information elements, as well as the underlying structure of Model A in general, are determined by the function dichotomies. 

## Function Dichotomies

Since there are 8 functions in Model A, they can be divided seven different ways into 2 groups of 4. This generates seven function dichotomies by which the functions can be defined and categorized. Let us express the functions numerically {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8} so that we may define the seven dichotomies as follows:

Strong/Weak

* Strong – Has an advanced understanding of this type of information.
* Weak – Has a simplistic understanding of this type of information.

Valued/Subdued

* Valued – The individual is attracted toward this type of information.
* Subdued – The individual is repelled away from this type of information.

Bold/Cautious

* Bold – This type of information is used more confidently.
* Cautious – This type of information is used more carefully.

## Functions

* **\[1\] Base Function** – The base function actively and competently processes the information it receives, forming the dominant perspective the individual interprets the world through. Conclusions reached by this function are often confident and serve as the primary motivation for expressed behavior.
  * Dichotomies – Strong, Valued, Bold, Inert, Mental, Accepting and Evaluatory.
* **\[2\] Creative Function** – The creative function readily adapts and adjusts to the needs of the base function, subtly influencing the dominant perspective set by it. Activated by the base function when the situation requires it.
  * Dichotomies – Strong, Valued, Cautious, Contact, Mental, Producing and Situational 
* **\[3\] Role Function** – The role function moderately and strenuously processes the information it receives, capably fulfilling the external demands placed on it to some degree. However, when required to act in unfamiliar situations, it can easily fail to meet expectations. The attitude towards the role is that it is something people feel that they should do, not something that they would want to do.
  * Dichotomies – Weak, Subdued, Bold, Contact, Mental, Accepting, Situational 
* **\[4\] Vulnerable Function** – The vulnerable function consistently rejects the information that it receives, failing to understand and recognize its importance. It can be a source of frustration for people, either because they are forced to use it themselves or have failed to consider it and have to endure the consequences. 
  * Dichotomies – Weak, Subdued, Cautious, Inert, Mental, Producing, Evaluatory 
* **\[5\] Suggestive Function** – The suggestive function struggles to process the information it receives. It knows what what information it needs, but doesn’t know how to get it on its own. Because of this, the suggestive function can become a source of neurosis when left unfulfilled. However, it happily accepts and adapts to outside support, resulting in a sense of bliss or completion when provided.
  * Dichotomies – Weak, Valued, Cautious, Contact, Vital, Accepting, Evaluatory 
* **\[6\] Mobilizing Function** – The mobilizing function is an area of high priority, but is initially inconsistent and unreliable in its output. If not careful, this variability can result in the individual attempting this function with overconfidence, only to mess up and feel shame for not living up to their expectations. It is only when a balanced approach, thus avoiding the extremes of confidence and shame, is when the mobilizing function grows and becomes more capable. Success in this area is difficult to achieve, but will feel very rewarding by the individual once it does. 
  * Dichotomies – Weak, Valued, Bold, Inert, Vital, Producing and Situational 
* **\[7\] Ignoring Function** – The ignoring function restricts the information it receives, only ever expanding in scope when there is an apparent need for it. The reason for this is that it shares the same information domain as the agenda-setting base function and as such, it is subordinated to its needs.
  * Dichotomies – Strong, Subdued, Cautious, Inert, Vital, Accepting and Situational. 
* **\[8\] Demonstrative Function** – The demonstrative function passively and competently processes information, operating in the background and providing support for the creative function when requested. Success in this area can be easily achieved, but it will not feel very rewarding by the individual. 
  * Dichotomies – Strong, Subdued, Bold, Contact, Vital, Producing and Evaluatory
