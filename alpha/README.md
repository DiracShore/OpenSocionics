## NeTi \| TiNe

Alphas are interested in exploring, investigating and understanding the natural world for its own sake. They view factual information as having a quality of logical interdependence, perceiving the parts that are common to different fields as being fundamentally interconnected as a whole. In that sense, the Alpha worldview is one in which multiple perspectives have been synthesized together to form an all-encompassing worldview that can logically account for every possible context. Alphas are also optimistic realizing new ideas, placing greater value in its potential than its present viability.

Alphas believe that life should be enjoyed calmly and experienced simply for what it is. They are drawn to environments of positive expression because they are more sensitive to unpleasant subject matters and prefer to keep their interactions with people harmonious overall. Furthermore, Alphas tend to freely associate between various groups and people, feeling energized by the jovial emotional energy present rather than the existing connections they have with any one group or individual.
