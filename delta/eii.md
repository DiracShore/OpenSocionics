# EII

## Fi-1

EIIs are highly introspective individuals who are deeply invested in upholding themselves to the ethical standards of their conscience. By focusing on their innermost sentiments, EIIs are able to determine how exactly they feel about other people, having an innate sense of the good and bad qualities of a person's character. However, EIIs do not instinctively divide people into categories of "good" and "evil", preferring instead to observe and refrain from judgement until they have thoroughly understood someone's innermost ethical nature. When the EII feels that they have understood the character of a person well enough, they can then develop a closer bond with people who are ethically improving themselves, while avoiding those who have no desire to become a better person.

## Ne-2

The two fundamental characteristics of EIIs are their openness towards learning new perspectives and their idealistic view of the inner character of people. While EIIs are primarily inclined to perceive things in optimistic terms, their focus is directed at the world's potential for improvement. For this reason, EIIs can place a great emphasis on hobbies and activities that can improve themselves and better assist those close to them. By extension, EIIs possess the same attitude towards people, that everyone has the potential to grow and develop as a person and that the right conditions need to be created for their inner qualities of good character to be fully realized.

## Ti-3

When required to carry out a logical analysis of events, EIIs can capably structure their thoughts into a consistent understanding and sort out inconsistencies between different perspectives. However, intellectual activities can cost the EII a lot of energy and simply analyzing how something works in theory doesn't provide them with what they actually need, which is knowing how it works in practice.

## Se-4

EIIs are unwilling and unable to confidently assert themselves against correcting harsh and cruel behavior in others, hesitating to take the forceful action required to stop or prevent it from happening. To the EII, impulsive behavior in general is perceived as reckless and irresponsible, having no forethought or consideration as to how other people are impacted.

## Te-5

Although diligent and conscientious in their work, EIIs are rarely aware of how efficiently they are working and tend to worry about whether or not their current performance is good enough. EIIs believe that they first must feel confident in what they have learned before applying it themselves, at which point, they can greatly appreciate relying on the assistance and competence of a trustworthy expert if they feel that their knowledge is lacking. At the same time, EIIs can also benefit from receiving the practical skills necessary to improve themselves and realize their altruistic goals.

## Si-6

Frequently, EIIs will strive to maintain harmony and stability in their surroundings and personal relationships with others. However, environmental upkeep doesn't come naturally to EIIs and they often end up exhausting themselves by conscientiously keeping their physical spaces convenient and orderly. In addition, while EIIs have a higher tolerance for unpleasant and abrasive behavior from others, the downside to this is they can also naively place their trust in people who will end up disrupting the very stability they worked so hard to create.

## Fe-7

EIIs tend to be quiet and reserved in social gatherings, resisting expressing themselves openly around people who aren't close to them. Commonly, EIIs behave very politely and passively contribute to group discussion, but this is done out of courtesy towards others, rather than for the purpose of belonging or identifying with any particular group. Even if feeling negative, EIIs are unlikely to open themselves up to others as they do not want to have inadvertently upset or burdened them with how they feel internally. However, around people they share a personal connection with, the gentle emotional warmth of the EII will naturally come through.

## Ni-8

EIIs spend a lot of time deep in thought, imagining how their actions in the present will unfold in the long-term and carefully monitoring the current direction in which their lives are headed. However, EIIs carry themselves with an attitude of noncommitment, keeping their options open and avoiding making decisions that would limit themselves to a singular path in life.
