# Alpha

## Alpha NT \(NeTi \| TiNe\)

Alphas are interested in exploring, investigating and understanding the natural world for its own sake. They view factual information as having a quality of logical interdependence, perceiving the parts that are common to different fields as being fundamentally interconnected as a whole. In that sense, the Alpha worldview is one in which multiple perspectives have been synthesized together to form an all-encompassing worldview that can logically account for every possible context. Alphas are also optimistic realizing new ideas, placing greater value in its potential than its present viability.
