# Information Elements\*

## Extroverted Intuition \(Ne\)

The aspect of Ne is the potential of information, diffracting into the different ways it can possibly be in the future, rather than what it currently is. Similar to like how white light diffracts into the colors of the rainbow when it passes through a prism, Ne processes conceptual abstractions and converts them into multiple new ideas. Determining the potential of an object requires knowledge of the concepts that are central to it, as well as the conceptual connections it shares with other objects. Since the potential of an object is interrelated with other objects, this information element is expansive in nature, where its usage entails new options and possibilities made readily available for the human mind to explore. When Ne is metabolized, it works towards exploring new perspectives where new avenues of potential can be realized.

## Introverted Intuition \(Ni\)

The aspect of Ni encompasses the conceptual associations between sources of information, connecting sequences of events across time. Throughout history, significant events have repeated themselves, though not in the same frequency nor intensity. These events in the past point to events in the future which directly follow them, thus forming a process of cause and effect. By definition, causality requires a limiting of possibilities to a singular outcome which is always brought about by a particular action. When Ni is metabolized, it reflects deeply on the patterns and trends behind events, resulting in a sense of knowing how things will turn out in the future and being able to predict when something will happen.

## Extroverted Sensing \(Se\)

The aspect of Se is the physical quality of information, the strength, impact and energy it has on other objects in the world. Human existence is marked by a disconnect between the limited supply of resources and the potentially limitless demand for those resources. This notion of scarcity is what drives people to compete, in which these resources acquired by force and defend them from opponents. While normally expressed in terms of the kinetics of physical bodies, Se also takes on the deeper psychological quality of volition or willpower, which is not explicitly physical. That is, Se should not be thought of simplistically in terms of physical strength, but more broadly as the volitional energy of a person. When metabolized, Se provides the individual with a decisiveness to act, confronting reality to fight off threats and get things done.

* volition
* willpower

## Introverted Sensing \(Si\)

The aspect of Si determines the information about the physical experience in a surrounding environment, how objects in space effect the inner state of a person and their sense of comfort. Si is primarily concerned with realizing a state of balance with the environment, specifically in which surrounding physical processes and the subject experiencing them have reached a point of homeostasis. However, moments of sudden outside activity and change can disturb the relationship between the environment and the person inhabiting it. When the sense of physical flow has been disrupt, the source of the disruption \(i.e. unpleasant or painful sensation\) can be easily identified from the natural flow. This is why Si is limiting and dynamic in nature, the scope of physical experience is restricted to what is comfortable, excluding what brings conflict, pain, unpleasantness, \(etc\). When metabolized, Si enables the person to use information from their five senses to identify which sensations are pleasant and which are unpleasant. This provides an individual with an identifiable metric by which they can more easily meet their internal demands.

Themes:  

* homeostasis
* harmony
* balance
* condition
* physical flow
* relaxation
* comfort
* sensory immersion
* noninterference
* conflict-avoidance

## Extroverted Logic \(Te\)

The aspect of Te is the factual content of information, the external activity of how mechanisms and processes operate in the world. In order to know how something works, it is necessary to accumulate relevant data about the subject. This can be done through a variety of different methodologies, such taking precise measurements and engaging in trial-and-error, as long as it prioritizes factual accuracy. In this sense, Te is expansive and dynamic in nature, increasing the quantity of data available and rapidly updating it alongside external observation. Te can be thought of as a posteriori knowledge, where empirical facts are validated by direct observation and experimentation. This type of knowledge can only be synthetic, since facts are context-dependent, they cannot be self-evidently true \(In other words, no truth derived from experience is tautological\). When metabolized, Te pragmatically selects the most useful and relevant pieces of information about a problem, finding a way to resolve it and optimize the process to work more efficiently.

Themes: 

* accuracy
* know-how
* procedure
* method 
* optimization 
* efficiency
* observation
* resource management
* productivity
* a posteriori

## Introverted Logic \(Ti\)

The aspect of Ti consists of the logical connections between sources of information, the objective parameters which truthfully define and structure everything in existence. When information has properties which are objectively shared \(i.e. a basket which has same amount of apples and oranges\), that body of information can be internally categorized based on a parameter that can be generalized \(in the example provided, the parameter is numerical\). This explains the restrictive and static nature of Ti, in which concepts are simplified into clear rules and generalities for others to understand. Ti can be thought of as a priori knowledge, in which truthful principles are deduced from pure reason. This specific type of knowledge can take different forms, depending on the subject that it is describing. The first form is the analytic proposition, where the axioms it contains are self-evidently true \(i.e. Euclidean geometry\). The second form, on the other hand, is the synthetic proposition, which is not self-evident, but is logically contingent when related to another concept \(i.e. theoretical physics\). When metabolized, Ti carefully examines information to identify what is consistent and what is inconsistent with how a body of knowledge is organized or what aligns with someone's current understanding.

Themes: 

* structure
* understanding
* formal logic
* category
* systems 
* consistency
* organization
* order
* principle
* a priori

## Extroverted Ethics \(Fe\)

The aspect of Fe is the dynamic spectrum of emotions, the internal state of activity of how someone feels from one moment to the next. While emotions exist internally, their qualities cannot be known until the person experiencing them expresses themselves, allowing the informational content to spread from person to person. In this way, Fe is expansive and dynamic in nature, increasingly involving and including people who are affected by it. When Fe is metabolized, there is a greater attentiveness towards the emotional content of how people communicate with each other, which either be verbal \(\*how\* something is said\) or nonverbal \(facial expressions\). More fundamentally, emotions can range from being more soothing/comforting to being intense/empowering and contain the message of a particular affect \(happy, sad, angry, anxious, etc.\)

Information Dichotomies: Internal, Involved, Rational, Extroverted, Continuous

Themes: 

* emotional expression
* passionate communication
* energetic emanation
* charisma
* moods

## Introverted Ethics \(Fi\)

The aspect of Fi embodies the innermost personal feelings which reside within people, motivating them to form deep relationships and interpersonal connections with others. Human connection is a basic psychological need, making friends and forming close bonds provide a psychological sense of safety and security. Fi also includes the fixed aspects of your own moral character, conveying to other people an instinctual impression of good/bad based on the consistent qualities in your own behavior. This also connects back to the concept of attraction/repulsion, where people attain a deeper insight as to who they should get to get close to and who they should avoid. When metabolized, Fi determines the basal attitudes of good/bad, like/dislike and love/hate within people, their level of attraction/repulsion towards objects in external reality. This results in people forming judgments of character about other people in their lives.

Information Dichotomies: Internal, Involved, Rational, Introverted, Discrete

Themes: 

* limiting communication
* personal feelings
* character
* moral integrity
* relationships
* inner conscience
* like / dislike 
* closeness / distance
* attraction / repulsion
