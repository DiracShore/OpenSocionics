# ILI

## Ni-1

ILIs are deeply perceptive individuals who tend to detach themselves from the world to focus on matters most deserving of their attention. These types commonly inhabit no other place than their own minds, revisiting past recollections and constantly refining their temporal understanding with new information. In this way, ILIs believe that the thorough investigation of both past and present is the best method to carefully forecast how the future will unfold. While the predictions of the ILI are generally critical and pessimistic, they simply want to convey to others how uninformed actions will lead to inevitable disaster. However, the reasons for why ILIs feel obligated to impart their predictions onto others can vary from case to case. Some may feel that they have a responsibility inform others because they believe such matters are greater than any one person. Others may take a strictly individualistic stance, only stepping in so that it doesn't negatively impact them.

## Te-2

The observant nature of the ILI often results in them accumulating a vast assortment of factual knowledge over time and evaluating how it can be useful to them in their own lives. The ILI perceives the usefulness of this knowledge in terms of how it can be used as evidence to support the conceptual trends and patterns they readily mentalize. Furthermore, the ILI is very much inclined to invest what they know into strategic planning, having an innate sense of knowing whether particular actions will end up producing favorable or unfavorable outcomes.

## Si-3

ILIs normally place minimal importance on environmental maintenance, investing enough effort into keeping things tidy so cluttered spaces won't end up being a distraction for them later. The rate at which they perform these tasks tend to be unhurried, going at their own pace and avoiding doing anything exhaustive. Generally speaking, ILIs care little for engaging in physical comforts and commonly default to frugality when faced with possibilities on how to make themselves more comfortable.

## Fe-4

ILIs are very emotionally reserved, rarely engaging in outward emotional expression. This can give people various negative impressions that ILIs are cold, uncompassionate and that they simply don't want to be around people. Whether or not this is actually true is irrelevant, as ILIs could care less how they are seen by others and reject the idea of social acceptance. Even if forced to interact with the world to prevent immanent catastrophe, ILIs will still refuse to make their words more palatable to others, seeing no point in sacrificing accurate sincerity for meaningless joviality.

## Se-5

The ILI's strong tendency towards risk-aversion can keep them in a state of inertia, being unsure of what exactly they want from the outside world. Similarly, when pressured by outside forces to take immediate action, ILIs can hesitate and take a while to make a final decision, at which point the window of opportunity may have already passed. To the ILI, involving themselves in the external world might disrupt their analytical projections of how they think the future will turn out, as the very act of participating might introduce unnecessary variables to account for and thus disrupt the chances of a desirable outcome. Naturally, the ILI prefers to entrust someone with great will and tenacity to put their plans in action, someone who can both call attention to the problem at hand and won't back down when confronted.

## Fi-6

While outwardly inexpressive, ILIs are nonetheless motivated to develop lasting emotional bonds with the select individuals they care about. However, ILIs are also generally disinterested in and routinely avoid social pleasantries, meaning that meeting new people who they can potentially befriend can be challenge for them. In fact, it is very common for other people to take the initiative to get to know the ILI rather than the opposite, and even in such cases where people do end up reaching out to them, the ILI might not always be interested in getting to know the other person and treat such attempts with skepticism. The friendships they have are formed entirely on their own terms, feeling comfortable once they know for certain their personal contacts consist of people they can trust. Although, to those the ILI personally dislikes, they will not bother keeping their ethical judgements hidden, directing their contempt in full towards those who deserve it.

## Ne-7

ILIs are very cautious about the conclusions they come to, refraining from making any prediction until they have gathered enough data and ruled out unlikely possibilities. However, once they have decided how things will most likely turn out, they will dismiss alternative outcomes as a waste of time. Similarly, ILIs have little patience for ideas that do not align with their current understanding of observed trends, rejecting any concept separated from what they have already observed as too na√Øve and not worth considering.

## Ti-8

ILIs are often able to decipher logical formal systems with ease, critically taking it apart into its constituent components and determining the logically consistency of each part. However interested the ILI may be in these systems, they are fundamentally disinterested in developing systematic models themselves, instead preferring to convey their own understanding to others independently of what any assortment of systems might entail. Similarly, ILIs are even less inclined to look at logical theories in terms of their potential, opting to use external examples of whether or not it ended up working instead.
