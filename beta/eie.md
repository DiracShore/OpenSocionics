# EIE

## Fe-1

EIEs are most readily focused on channeling their dynamic emotional states into outward displays of self-expression. These types normally have an extensive emotional range and are greatly motivated to express how they feel without constraint, feeling contented only when they have found an audience willing to listen to their messages. What comes naturally to the EIE is their generation of a collective mood that has the intended purpose of affecting others, whether it be inherently positive or negative in orientation. EIEs masterfully channel their broad range of emotional expressions to characterize the sheer power and depth of their experiences. In addition to this, EIEs are motivated to project an image of themselves that authentically conveys how they feel in the present moment. However, due to the EIE's turbulent and rapidly changing emotional states, this can result in them similarly altering their social image to match how they want to present themselves to people in that moment.

## Ni-2

Often, EIEs want to commit themselves to a fixed vision of how they think the world should be and scrupulously analyze the past to better adapt themselves to the future. This comprehension of how events develop dynamically over time gives EIEs the ability to sift through past and present trends to determine the abstract ideals that are most significant to them. Once the EIE has figured out what their mission or goal is, they will feel inclined to motivate and rally others to their cause with a profound persuasiveness. Even though EIEs can be predisposed to periods of deep reflection, it is uncommon to EIE in a state of passive observation, as they are much more typically driven to enthusiastically communicate their insights to the public. Additionally, EIEs are captivated by their own destinies and seek to bring the ideas of the past that are close to their hearts into the present. Consequently, it is not uncommon to see EIEs switching between social roles and testing out different modes of expression on others, so long as it helps them achieve the goals that they've envisioned.

## Te-3

EIEs recognize the need to be responsible and are conscientious of the tasks they delegate, investing a great deal of effort into getting their work done quickly and efficiently. Yet, this is only true if the EIE's line of work satisfies what their passions dictate. Furthermore, EIEs find that the communication of procedural steps or facts is boring and will want to imbue their tireless emotional energy into it, keeping their audience engaged and ready to act on a moment's notice. 

## Si-4

EIEs reject simple, ordinary living and will always want to strive for something greater. The root of this lofty ambition has to do with the EIE's negative outlook on the present. This usually manifests in EIEs espousing that something is fundamentally wrong with the world as it is and people need to be mobilized to change it. In any case, EIEs tend to get so caught up in the bigger picture that they inadvertently overlook or even neglect the minor responsibilities that are negligible to them. The restless activity of these types tends to result in them being unable to relax, in some cases even sacrificing their comfort and wellbeing for a cause they find noble.

## Ti-5

EIEs find it difficult to differentiate and organize the logical elements of their thoughts from their present emotional states. However, EIEs are very appreciative of those who are able to order their scattered insight into a formalized system they can safely depend upon. Even though these types might initially struggle with structuring their ideas, they can nonetheless express prolific insight on various topics, commonly of a social or cultural nature. Furthermore, it is not uncommon to see EIEs as didactic conversationalists, probing the intricacies of a dialogue so that they can assure that their understanding of a subject is correct.

## Se-6

EIEs carry themselves with a driven volition to push past those who challenge them and changing how things presently are to fit their vision. However, the apparent "toughness" of EIEs tends to be exaggerated for affect, being less reflective of how they actually are. In some cases, the tenacity of EIEs can occasionally lead them to exaggerate what they're capable of and put them into situations where they are unable to act decisively.

## Fi-7

Even though EIEs are attentive to how they feel internally, they often suppress and deny their personal attitudes toward people. This is because their emotions are in a constant state of flux and differentiating their feelings into specific sentiments diminishes the quality of the messages they want to share. To EIEs, emotions should not be merely felt internally, but used as a means to bring people together and have impact on the world. Similarly, EIEs are social butterflies by nature, actively building new social contacts with new people and not wanting to limit themselves to existing contacts. 

## Ne-8

EIEs generally take an extensive interest in a wide range of topics and enjoy discussing ideas and concepts out in the open. They are not open to all ideas however, as they can just as easily discard ideas that do not match their own insight. In these instances, they can view open-ended brainstorming as a pointless distraction from what is actually important in the long-term. It is natural for the EIE to apply their insight to areas where they are trying to achieve something, rather than endlessly exploring different topics that miss the point of what they want to accomplish. EIEs appreciate those who are able to explain concretely to them how things are and what should be done as it prevents them from falling into periods of doubt and scatteredness.
