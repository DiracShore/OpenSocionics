# SLI

## Si-1

SLIs are excellent at organizing their surroundings and have meticulous attention to detail towards making their physical experience of the world as convenient and harmonious as possible. The creation of these physical spaces is liberating for the SLI, as its sensory qualities are finely tuned to their internal demands, giving them respite from the discomfort and pressure of the outside world. Furthermore, SLIs are deeply invested in meeting their sensory needs for the sake of ensuring that they are productive when they need to be and do not needlessly drain themselves of their energy.

## Te-2

SLIs often possess a dense assortment of factual knowledge at their disposal. This knowledge can range from scientific data, historical information, financial management, though this assortment is predominantly technical in nature. They consider it not only important to know about how things work for the sake of solving practical problems, but as a way to become more self-sufficient in their own lives. For instance, SLIs learn easily through directly and tangibly interacting with materials and tools, like working with their hands.

## Ni-3

Generally, SLIs are capable of deep mental abstraction and reflecting on how their lives will develop in the future. This can help the SLI know whether a particular initiative is worth working on or not, saving time and energy for them to direct their efforts elsewhere. Although, SLIs are motivated to think prudently only when they see it is necessary to do so, primarily when it pertains to activities in their own lives. They do not see the value of grandiose causes and meanings that are too disconnected from what they tangibly perceive in the present.

## Fe-4

SLIs are not very emotionally expressive and have difficulty communicating to others how they feel. From the outside, they can appear cold, stoic and taciturn, but this is limited range of expression is not deliberate. The reason that SLIs opt for a calm emotional exterior is simply because this is a more peaceful state for them and they see little reason to involve themselves in the overwhelming passions other people get caught up in. Similarly, SLIs are prominent individualists, preferring to ignore social expectations they think are unnecessary and avoid the social spotlight.

## Ne-5

Normally, SLIs tend to limit themselves to activities and experiences they are already familiar and comfortable with. This can result in SLIs forming restrictive comfort zones, opting for what is tried and true over speculating how it could be improved. However, SLIs are very appreciative of people who are able to introduce them to new ideas, possibilities and perspectives that they can practically apply to the real world.

## Fi-6

SLIs would like to develop deep interpersonal connections with people, but they rarely ever venture outside their solitary lifestyle to meet new people. In addition to this, SLIs can also be very attached to how they feel personally, but fail to adequately communicate this with others, resulting in them carefully seeking kinship, but unintentionally coming across as closed-off and stubborn to those they like. In reality, SLIs act in a way which is gentle and respectful towards people and they want to encounter others who see them for who they really are on the inside.

## Se-7

The physical spaces which SLIs are motivated to create primarily function as a place of refuge from the pressure and external demands of the outside world. When they are faced with aggression, SLIs are usually inclined to ignore it, calmly avoiding it and refusing to engage with the aggressor. However, if such aggression infringes upon their own comfort level, SLIs are capable of pushing back somewhat to diffuse the source of conflict, thus preventing future altercations.

## Ti-8

Though they are not driven to develop holistic systems of understanding, SLIs are skilled at resolving inconsistencies in logic and deciphering the general truths behind what they encounter.
