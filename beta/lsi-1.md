# LSI

## Ti-1

LSIs are prolific organizers of information who subject everything to logical analysis, filtering out inconsistencies and limiting extraneous information that does not fit into their understanding. Once they have developed their interpretation of a topic, LSIs stringently impose their formulations into the social, political, economic or cultural domains of life, educating others on why the structure is necessary and how it should be implemented. LSIs see great significance in outlining the rules that govern society, leading by example to demonstrate that the rules in place are not only fair, but just to everyone who follows them. Furthermore, it is common to see LSIs use their analytical precision as a guide for dealing with new information.

## Se-2

When confronted with a perspective that contradicts their own, the LSI will demonstrate unwavering assertiveness in disproving the reasoning behind it. As such, LSIs can be audaciously confrontational and will criticize anything that directly contradicts or challenges their principles. Furthermore, LSIs are fairly active and decisive individuals who are just as prepared to tear down the old order as they are to preserve the new. If in a position of leadership, an LSI will assume the social role of an enforcer to implement the rules they deem necessary to create an orderly environment that is to their liking.

## Fi-3

LSIs carefully build their relationships with people to see if they are just, trustworthy and reliable. Once an LSI accepts someone into their social circle, they can deviate from their usual detachedness and present an unwavering loyalty towards that person. Although, LSIs are private people who tend to be naturally distrustful of those they don't know very well. This can be a source of stress for the LSI if they have identified someone they personally like, but fail to uphold the obligations the LSI entrusted them with. In this sense, LSIs have an easier time dealing with people who uphold the same principles as they do and are responsible enough to carry out what they think is important.

## Ne-4

LSIs leave no room for "what ifs" and uncertainty. To LSIs, most issues are must either be correct or incorrect according to their precise worldview. If an LSI is confronted with many possible solutions to a problem that they thought only had one, they will get frustrated and question the validity of these solutions if they are not conducive to getting the outcome exactly the way they see it. Furthermore, the LSI's stubborn thinking often causes them to overlook the perspectives they perceive as being logically inconsistent and they will only change their mind if said perspective has been demonstrated to be unarguably correct. If a situation continues to be ambiguous, LSIs will take up the mantle to control their surroundings to ensure that the outcome is exactly what they intend it to be.

## Fe-5

Left to their own devices, LSIs are aloof and formal individuals who have difficult time expressing themselves in a cordial and uplifting way. However, once they have found a group of people that likes them, the LSI will begin to open up and feel more at ease. They would be far more likely to prefer to be admired by an audience that agrees with the tenets of their system than by altering their social image to get more people engaged. 

## Ni-6

Early on in their lives, LSIs dedicate themselves to figuring out what their central purpose in life is and how they can bring about meaningful change in the world. It should be noted that LSIs will want to figure out what their own sense of purpose is themselves and they will only commit to a cause that aligns exactly with how they see the future will turn out. Once the LSI has figured out what their intended vision is, they can more confidently act according to it. In such instances, they will prioritize the preservation of traditions that are most significant to them.

## Te-7

The structures that the LSI creates are supported by their substantial knowledge of how the real world operates. Frequently, these structures can greatly improve the processes that they are applied to, smoothing over previous complications in efficiency by having everything running according to schedule. However, if said structure fails to do this, LSI will rarely feel the need to revise their methodology and perceive any changes to this as disproving the structure as a whole. Furthermore, if external evidence challenges the rigid viewpoints of the LSI, they will be quick to note the unreliability of said evidence to suggest with certainty that their positions are false.

## Si-8

LSIs are diligent organizers, ordering their surroundings in a way that is comfortable and presentable. Their meticulous attention to detail can give them a perfectionistic streak and they will ensure that their expectations are met. However, LSIs do allocate time for relaxation, but only once they have finished their responsibilities and have no available tasks that need their immediate attention.
