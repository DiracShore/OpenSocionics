# SLE

## Se-1

SLEs are characterized by their strength of will and continuous drive towards fulfilling their ambitions. The environments that SLEs inhabit are perceived in terms of their power dynamics and as such, they invest an intensive amount of effort and energy into acquiring greater control over them. The decisive and tough nature of SLEs is often complemented by their ability to actively ascend past competitors towards a position of leadership.

## Ti-2

SLEs are often proficient at understanding how logical systems operate in reality. To the SLE, their analytical skill is treated more as a means to end, navigating the world and exercising control as they see fit. SLEs can even be focused on producing logical systems themselves, tearing down the old system and enforcing a new one in its place. Additionally, SLEs can be staunch defenders of the principles they believe in, seeking to crush their opponents in debate with quick rhetoric and flexible reasoning.

## Ne-3

While predisposed to confronting problems in a single-minded way, SLEs can be open considering other alternatives to addressing the problem, usually when first decision they took did not work. SLEs also tolerate ambiguity, so long as it does not distract them from the goal ahead and they can prove to be decent at improvising with sufficient effort.

## Fi-4

The driven resoluteness of SLEs can cause them to neglect how people may feel internally. Similarly, SLEs give little attention to their internal attitudes about people and have even less patience for the personal attitudes others have about their actions. 

## Ni-5

Since SLEs actively devote focus more on the immediate impact their actions have on the world, SLEs are much less aware of the longer-term consequences that will incur. With more life experience, however, the SLE may become dissatisfied with menial battles and seek to align themselves with a higher purpose so that their actions may have a greater impact on the world.

## Fe-6

The SLE strives toward higher goals not only for the influence they might have over others, but the prestige and admiration that follows. While SLEs are easily energized by environments of free-expression, their tough demeanor of SLEs can come off as abrasive and tactless to others. Initially, SLEs can deliberately engage in shocking and offensive commentary to invoke reactions in others they find humorous. Over time however, this desire to shock others can develop into a desire to motivate and guide others under their strong leadership.

## Si-7

While understanding the importance of rest and relaxation, SLEs rarely engage in these types of activities for their own sake. Instead, they will prefer to take care of their physical well-being only if it will become an obstacle to the goals they set for themselves. Engaging in material comforts functions as a way for the SLE to recharge their energy state so that they can return to their usual vitality.

## Te-8

SLEs are skilled at fixing problems that require pragmatic expertise. If they do not currently possess knowledge of how to do something, they can prove to be fast learners on different topics and can acquire the skills needed to lift the technical barriers that prevent them from reaching their goals. Beyond this, SLEs are not so interested in learning for its own sake if it does not serve an immediate purpose to them.
