# LII

## Ti-1

LIIs are analytical investigators of the structures and principles that ordain their lives. The interests of the LII essentially exist in the intellectual domain, where they rationally uncover and evaluate the reasoning that ordain logical relationships. Although these types can perform well in scientific fields, LIIs will nonetheless want to understand and be able to explain the topics that interest them at length. Mainly, the process by which LIIs construct logical concepts are very thorough, with them naturally revisiting and thinking over the given reasons for their constructs until they are certain that the conclusion that they have reached is absolutely correct.

## Ne-2

In support of their abstract thinking, LIIs perceive the multiple avenues of potential that are related to a given idea or concept with delineation and clarity. They devote great attention and thought to the wide range of perspectives where their logic can be applied, deriving general principles to account for various cases and circumstances. This can include, for instance, proposing unconventional thought experiments and theoretical proofs in an effort to convey different perspectives to people. LIIs commonly have a wide range of intellectual interests, but they are also deeply investigators of a limited range of topics.

## Fi-3

LIIs prefer to experience their emotions privately without being intruded upon by others. Since they are generally quite detached and socially introverted, LIIs convey a formalistic and measured self-presentation because they more attentive to the rules of behavior, and not necessarily their personal attitudes, to build relationships with people. In situations of personal conflict, LII will not know how to engage with it, withdrawing into themselves until the situation boils over. Furthermore, it is really only in heated debates that LIIs will default to being more stubborn-minded, they are not confrontational beyond this. They are not the sort of person who will actively reach out to people to get to know them, but when they do end up forming close relationships, it usually ends up being with those who cheer them up and help them feel included. On average though, their social circles will be quite limited. 

## Se-4

LIIs portray a mild-mannered demeanor and are avoidant of situations where they are expected to act decisively and forcefully to get something done. If pressured or confronted from the outside, LIIs can utterly fail to defend themselves in these situations, resulting in them withdrawing from conflict altogether and inwardly turning their criticism on themselves.

## Fe-5

LIIs want to be socially accepted by people who consider them to be insightful people who have interesting things to say. They are drawn to cheerful environments and people who actively broadcast positive emotions in their direction, to show that the LII is welcome and appreciated. Once a positive mood has been set, LIIs appear to be more cordial and jovial than they seemingly were before. LIIs also find these environments convenient for openly discussing and proliferating their ideas and theories with an audience. Despite this, LIIs are not very skilled at managing and bringing people together, interacting with people distantly and not wanting to be in the spotlight. If the atmosphere becomes too negative or hostile, LII will disengage and look for a different community to participate in. Similarly, if LIIs are unable to find a source of positive emotionality in their lives, they can be more isolated and privacy-seeking.

## Si-6

LIIs develop by engaging in calming physical activities that give them a sense of enjoyment and groundedness in the present. Their actual level of physical attentiveness can vary though, where in some instances the LII will be meticulously absorbed in a relaxing activity, and in other instances, neglecting their physical space altogether to devote more time for philosophizing. It would also not be unrealistic to see some LIIs having athletic hobbies, as it's not too competitive or physically demanding. As a consequence, the fear of sensory overwhelm can cause LIIs will to pursue these activities in moderation to avoid physical exhaustion. LIIs also normally express some confidence in being able to dress tastefully, though it is far more important to them that what they're wearing is physically comfortable.

## Te-7

LIIs have a natural preference for carefully deducing logical conclusions from the facts they encounter. When collecting the data necessary to reaffirm these conclusions, the LII will treat ambiguous assortments of data with skepticism and will instead see if they align with the systems they've created. While LIIs can passively collect a dense knowledge base over time, they will be very selective about what facts are used perfect their logical line of reasoning. The LII will be more concerned that the rationale for their structure is correct than whether or not it is useful or applicable in real life.

## Ni-8

Generally speaking, LIIs are very pensive individuals who devote a lot of energy to contemplating and observing how patterns develop over time. However, this type will often feel more inclined to convert their insightful observations into static categories that are internally consistent and contingent. In this way, the structures that LIIs produce can often be so abstract and expansive that they might not even have a teleological end, purpose or application in the real world. Many LIIs can develop their own philosophical perspective on life by integrating the conclusions reached by many different perspectives and see little point in narrowing their own perspective into a condensed, concrete model.
