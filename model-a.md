# Model A

During the development of Socionics, Aushra Augusta made the important realization that all 8 information elements are present in the human psyche, but each individual information element possesses a different level of strength, priority and awareness in a person. She theorized that there must be a mathematical model of the human psyche which structures the 8 information elements into 8 unique functions of psychological input and output. Thus, in 1978, Model A \(A is short for Augusta\) was created. The information elements cannot be placed arbitrarily, otherwise there would be 40320 \(8! = 40320\) personality types and not 16. The rules for the placement of these information elements, as well as the underlying structure of Model A in general, are determined by the function dichotomies. 

## Function Dichotomies

Since there are 8 functions in Model A, they can be divided seven different ways into 2 groups of 4. This generates seven function dichotomies by which the functions can be defined and categorized. Let us express the functions numerically {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8} so that we may define the seven dichotomies as follows:

_Author's Note: In how I apply Model A, I have made note of distinguishing dichotomies are essential for determining someone's type from those that have little to no observable presence._

**Strong/Weak** \(Observable\)

* Strong – Has an advanced understanding of this type of information.
* Weak – Has a simplistic understanding of this type of information.

**Valued/Subdued \(**Observable\)

* Valued – The individual is attracted toward this type of information.
* Subdued – The individual is repelled away from this type of information.

**Bold/Cautious** \(Observable\)

* **Bold** – This type of information is used more confidently.
* **Cautious** – This type of information is used more carefully.

**Inert/Contact** \(Observable\)

* **Inert** – Stubbornly resists adapting to outside input. 
* **Contact** – Flexibly adapts and changes with outside input.

**Mental/Vital** \(Structural\)

* **Mental** – This type of information serves external demands, what we bring to the world.
* **Vital** – This type of information serves internal demands, what we fulfill for ourselves.

**Accepting/Producing** \(Structural\)

* **Accepting** – Sets a particular need or want after processing the information.
* **Producing** – Provides new information in response to the need or want set by the Accepting function.

**Evaluatory/Situational** \(Structural\)

* **Evaluatory** – These functions are consistently set in a particular state of activity independent of the situation.
* **Situational** – These functions can switch between states of activity depending on the situation.

## Functions

### **\[1\] Base Function**

The base function actively and competently processes the information it receives, forming the dominant perspective the individual interprets the world through. Conclusions reached by this function are often confident and serve as the primary motivation for expressed behavior.

* Observable Dichotomies – Strong, Valued, Bold and Inert
* Structural Dichotomies – Mental, Accepting and Evaluatory

### **\[2\] Creative Function** 

The creative function readily adapts and adjusts to the needs of the base function, subtly influencing the dominant perspective set by it. Activated by the base function when the situation requires it.

* Observable Dichotomies – Strong, Valued, Cautious, Contact, 
* Structural Dichotomies – Mental, Producing and Situational 

### **\[3\] Role Function**

The role function moderately and strenuously processes the information it receives, capably fulfilling the external demands placed on it to some degree. However, when required to act in unfamiliar situations, it can easily fail to meet expectations. The attitude towards the role is that it is something people feel that they should do, not something that they would want to do.

* Observable Dichotomies – Weak, Subdued, Bold and Contact
* Structural Dichotomies – Mental, Accepting and Situational 

### **\[4\] Vulnerable Function** 

The vulnerable function consistently rejects the information that it receives, failing to understand and recognize its importance. It can be a source of frustration for people, either because they are forced to use it themselves or have failed to consider it and have to endure the consequences. 

* Observable Dichotomies – Weak, Subdued, Cautious and Inert
* Structural Dichotomies – Mental, Producing and Evaluatory 

### **\[5\] Suggestive Function**

The suggestive function struggles to process the information it receives. It knows what what information it needs, but doesn’t know how to get it on its own. Because of this, the suggestive function can become a source of neurosis when left unfulfilled. However, it happily accepts and adapts to outside support, resulting in a sense of bliss or completion when provided.

* Observable Dichotomies – Weak, Valued, Cautious and Contact
* Structural Dichotomies – Vital, Accepting and Evaluatory 

### **\[6\] Mobilizing Function** 

The mobilizing function is an area of high priority, but is initially inconsistent and unreliable in its output. If not careful, this variability can result in the individual attempting this function with overconfidence, only to mess up and feel shame for not living up to their expectations. It is only when a balanced approach, thus avoiding the extremes of confidence and shame, is when the mobilizing function grows and becomes more capable. Success in this area is difficult to achieve, but will feel very rewarding by the individual once it does. 

* Observable Dichotomies – Weak, Valued, Bold and Inert
* Structural Dichotomies – Vital, Producing and Situational 

### **\[7\] Ignoring Function**

The ignoring function restricts the information it receives, only ever expanding in scope when there is an apparent need for it. The reason for this is that it shares the same information domain as the agenda-setting base function and as such, it is subordinated to its needs.

* Observable Dichotomies – Strong, Subdued, Cautious and Inert
* Structural Dichotomies – Vital, Accepting and Situational

### **\[8\] Demonstrative Function** 

The demonstrative function passively and competently processes information, operating in the background and providing support for the creative function when requested. Success in this area can be easily achieved, but it will not feel very rewarding by the individual. 

* Observable Dichotomies – Strong, Subdued, Bold ****and Contact 
* Structural Dichotomies – Vital, Producing and Evaluatory

## Placement Rules

As stated earlier, there is a specific set of rules that limits the number of type combinations to 16. By placing one information element into one function, that limits the number of possible types to 2, because the placement of one implies the placement of 3 other information elements in specific function positions. Now that the function dichotomies have been explained, here is the list of the rules for constructing a model for a specific type: 

1. Each information element can only occupy one function position in the model. 

2. If a Bold function is Extroverted, the remaining Bold functions are also Extroverted and the Cautious functions are Introverted. If a Bold function is Introverted, the reverse is true. 

3. If a Mental function is Static, the remaining three Mental functions are also Static and the Vital functions are all Dynamic. If a Mental function is Dynamic, the reverse is true. 

4. If an Accepting function is Rational, the remaining three accepting functions are also Rational and the Producing functions are all Irrational. If an Accepting function is Irrational, the reverse is true. 

## Function Tetrachotomies

To understand how the functions relate and influence each other on a deeper level, it is necessary to introduce and describe the subgroups of Model A. When a dichotomy is applied to Model A, that divides a group of 8 elements into 2 groups of 4 elements. Applying two dichotomies divides the group of 8 elements into 4 groups of 2 elements, generating a tetrachotomy. The implications of tetrachotomies are crucial to Model A, as it produces seven different ways that the functions can be paired together. Here is a diagram of the possible pairings that can be generated with the function dichotomies: There are two forms of function pairing, called blocks and axes. A block is comprised of an Accepting function and a Producing function, while an axis is either comprised of two Accepting functions or two Producing functions. 

### Blocks 

For blocking, Aushra classically observed only one form of it, the horizontal block, while the rest were at least implied to have existed mathematically, but were not described in any kind of detail. Some Socionists believe that there is only one kind of blocking, but I argue that is very wrong to dismissively reach this conclusion. Simply because one form of blocking is the most natural and convenient for a person to use, does not mean that it is the only kind of information blocking. What is unique about information blocking is that when two IM elements occupy a block, that means that they can either both be “on” or “off” \(except for the base function, which is always “on”\). These are the four types of information blocks: 

#### Horizontal Blocks 

\[1-2\] Ego Block – The core of our strengths that we bring to the world and the form of behavior which feels the most natural to us.

\[3-4\] Super-Ego Block – An area of weakness that we do not see the point of and do not aspire to be.

\[5-6\] Super-Id Block – An area of weakness that is also an early aspirational area of growth. Although weak, can be capable of leveling up with self improvement and outside support.

\[7-8\] Id Block – An area which we have capability in, but do not see the point of. Utilized when needed, but otherwise consciously rejected.

#### Vertical Blocks 

\[1-4\] Disconnect Block – The area of the psyche that is the point of greatest disconnect. These functions stubbornly insist upon their way of approaching the world and are almost never used together. 

\[2-3\] Adaptive Block – How we openly connect and adapt to the challenges the world places on us. Tends to be used temporarily based on the situation. 

\[5-8\] Compliant Block – Low resistance to outside influence, allowing other people to provide support and feedback. 

\[6-7\] Reactive Block – Highly resistant to outside influence, takes care of this area of life themselves. 

#### Dimensional Blocks 

\[1-8\] 4D Block – Processed at a very advanced level, forming the strongest area of our behavior. 

\[2-7\] 3D Block – Processed at a slightly advanced level, knowing when to be active or dormant depending on the situation. 

\[3-6\] 2D Block – Processed at an adequate level, can capably meet particular norms and standards, but can easily exhaust itself when used too much. 

\[4-5\] 1D Block – Processed at a very basic level, can only learn how to improve through experience and outside assistance. 

#### Priority Blocks 

\[1-6\] 4P Block – Main priority in life, is responsible for setting primary goals and motivations, given constant thought and attention. 

\[2-5\] 3P Block – Secondary priority in life, it is an area of which is given considerable attention, but does not consistently drive goals and motivations. 

\[3-8\] 2P Block – Partial priority, its importance is recognized and given some attention, but is not valued for its own sake. 

\[4-7\] 1P Block – Trivial, conflicts with primary goals and motivations, is rarely given conscious attention.

### Axes 

There are also three axes, which are distinct from blocks in that the IM elements in each pair are cannot be used together. By focusing on one IM element, that implies the one you are using is “on”, while the rest of the IM elements in the shares axes are “off” \(except for the vulnerable function, which is always “off”\). The axes simply represents what information elements you naturally prefer, which in turn, determines what Quadra values you have. 

#### Temperament Axes 

\[1-3\] T1 Axis – The Base is strongly preferred over the Role, but the latter can have a softening/humanizing affect on the former. 

\[2-4\] T2 Axis – The Creative is strongly preferred over the Vulnerable, with the former being the most useful to the Base and the latter, the least useful to the Base. 

\[5-7\] T3 Axis – The Suggestive is preferred over the Ignoring, but neither are outwardly expressed.

\[6-8\] T4 Axis – The Mobilizing is preferred over the Demonstrative, but both are highly influential on the mindset of the individual.

#### Quadra Axes 

\[1-5\] Q1 Axis – The Base is what we bring to the world and the Suggestive is what we seek from it. We strongly value both. 

\[2-6\] Q2 Axis – The Creative is slightly preferred over the Mobilizing due to the former’s strength, but both tend to be balanced. 

\[3-7\] Q3 Axis – The Role is slightly preferred over the Ignoring, but it is possible for both to be balanced.

\[4-8\] Q4 Axis – The Demonstrative is preferred over the Vulnerable. 

#### Jungian Axes 

\[1-7\] J1 Axis – The Base function is strongly preferred over the Ignoring function. 

\[2-8\] J2 Axis – The Creative function is preferred over the Demonstrative function, but is partially contaminated/influenced by it. 

\[3-5\] J3 Axis – The Suggestive function \(5\) is preferred over the Role function \(3\), but the latter ends up taking charge if the former is left unsupported. 

\[4-6\] J4 Axis – The Mobilizing function is strongly preferred over the Vulnerable function.
