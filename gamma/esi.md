# ESI

## Fi-1

ESIs are highly perceptive of their innermost feelings, upholding themselves and others to the standards of their own conscience. The ESI's attitudinal awareness can prove to be very useful for them in knowing who they should form a close connection with and who should be avoided. As such, the moral estimations of ESIs are very direct and severe, not being afraid of voicing what they see as reprehensible behavior.

## Se-2

The resoluteness of ESIs are primarily guided by the moral judgements they hold and the protection of those dear to them. If someone is behaving unethically, the ESI will not hesitate to confront and challenge them until the situation has been resolved. In the same way, ESIs are driven to serve as an example of morally upright behavior, challenging themselves and others to do what the ESI feels is right.

## Ti-3

ESIs are capable of investigating matters of logical consistency with sufficient effort, but can feel largely inhibited in their understanding when dealing with abstract or theoretical material. Likewise, while they may feel motivated to justify their behavior in accordance with logical principles, the integrity of their moral rectitude takes precedence.

## Ne-4

When challenged with an issue that requires abstract speculation, ESIs can feel easily overwhelmed by having to mentally keep track of multiple perspectives and interpretations, especially if they have little to no bearing in reality. In their own lives, ESIs will have even less patience for ambiguity, either tending to anxiously overprepare for any possible outcome or failing to even recognize that the situation could have developed differently from what they originally thought. Furthermore, this feeling of skepticism can also extend into the field of the ESI's relationships, feeling more comfortable with ending a relationship if they see the other person as untrustworthy or unfaithful, rather than taking the time to speculate on whether or not they had good intentions to begin with.

## Te-5

Although skeptical and level-headed, ESIs do not feel very confident in their ability to evaluate new information themselves or figuring out the most optimal way it can be applied to their own lives. What ESIs feel more comfortable with is determining the quality of the factual data they receive based on the trustworthiness of the person it comes from, irrespective of its actual factual content. If they are receiving said expertise from someone they trust, they greatly appreciate reassurance and feedback so that they know how to perform a task in the most efficient way possible.

## Ni-6

A source of conscious attention for the ESI is the fulfillment of their individual purpose and having a clear vision of where their lives are going. Sometimes, ESIs may overestimate the clarity of their strategic insight, either acting too early and impulsively or too late, having lost the desired opportunity due to inaction. While ESIs can be slow to make adjustments in the goals that they set for themselves, they can eventually make these changes when given practical reassurance on the sensibility of their endeavors.

## Fe-7

ESIs tend to be private individuals who are minimally inclined to a maintain group atmosphere, only appearing more sociable when among friends and familiar people. Similarly, ESIs are fundamentally disinterested in emotionally affecting others outside of those they are close to. Furthermore, while understanding of the need to behave cordially in the presence of people they personally dislike, they can just as easily abandon this fa√ßade of cordiality and ruthlessly criticize the disliked person if they feel it is necessary to do so.

## Si-8

While not a central priority for them, ESIs are nonetheless predisposed towards the detailed maintenance of their living spaces. In fact, ESIs rarely engage in matters of sensory fulfillment for its own sake and are far more likely to exercise rigorous self-discipline in the management of their physical state. ESIs also tend to be selective in sensory provisions, only providing care for those they trust and help develop the existing bonds they have with people.
