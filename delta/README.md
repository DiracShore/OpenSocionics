# Delta

## NeFi \| FiNe

Deltas are inclined to view the character of others with optimism, believing that someone who has done wrong could be misunderstood and has the potential to become a better person. 

## SiTe \| TeSi

Deltas take a purely pragmatic approach to factual information, looking for ways they can make gradual improvements to make physical processes better and more efficient. They view work as a type of optimization problem, wanting to balance the quality work performed with the amount of effort put in to produce it. Unlike Alphas, they are less concerned with aesthetics and comfort as they are with functionality and user-friendliness. 

## NeTe \| TeNe

Deltas like to learn a variety of practical skills for the sake of broadening their own horizons and opening themselves up to new opportunities and experiences. They prefer to examine multiple perspectives and sources to see if any useful information can be derived from them and applied to their own lives. As a consequence of diligently and continuously improving upon what they know, they tend to be more self-sufficient on the whole.

## SiFi \| FiSi

Deltas are down-to-earth and easygoing people at their core, preferring to go their own way without interfering with others.
